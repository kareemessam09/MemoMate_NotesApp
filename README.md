# MemoMate - Your Personal Notes App
MemoMate is a sleek and intuitive Notes app built using Java. It's the culmination of my exploration into Java layouts and Room database, resulting in a robust and user-friendly application.

# Features
* Stylish Layout: Utilizes StaggeredGridLayoutManager for a visually appealing recyclerView.
* Search Functionality: Easily find your notes with the built-in search bar.
* Colorful Notes: Notes appear in two columns with randomly selected colors for a personalized touch.
* Convenient Actions: Long-press on note cards to access options for pinning/unpinning or deleting notes.
